currently:
    - add priors

further:
    - rework config class.
      create virtual parent class for config classes.
      enable virtual typedefs my making the config superclass a template class.
    - implement vanishing points algorithm
    - optimize (look at alphaexpansion implementation of opengm)
    - far future: opencl implementation? look at nvidia's paper
