currently:
    - implement directly on top of liblemon

further:
    - add ycm
    - add priors
    - add priors to feedback graph
    - rework config class.
      create virtual parent class for config classes.
      enable virtual typedefs my making the config superclass a template class.
    - implement vanishing points algorithm
    - optimize (look at alphaexpansion implementation of opengm)
    - far future: opencl implementation? look at nvidia's paper
